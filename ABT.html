<p>Infected computer programs may include data files, or even the "boot" sector of the hard drive.
Types of Virus: The following are the major types of computer virus:
(i)	Worms
This is a computer program that replicates itself at a swift pace. Unlike a computer virus, it is self-contained and hence does not need to be part of another program to propagate itself.
(ii)	Trojan Horse
A Trojan Horse is also a sort of destructive program that remains disguised in a normal software program. It is not exactly a virus, as it cannot replicate itself. However, there is possibility that virus program may remain concealed in the Trojan Horse.
(iii)	Bombs
It is similar to Trojan Horse, but Logic bombs have some specialty; these include a timing device and hence it will go off only at a particular date and time.
How does virus affect your computer system:?
•	By downloading files from the Internet.
•	During the removable of media or drives.
•	Through pen drive.
•	Through e-mail attachments.
•	Through unpatched software</p>  & services.
•	Through unprotected or poor administrator passwords.
Impact of Virus
•	Disrupts the normal functionality of respective computer system.
•	Disrupts system network use.
•	Modifies configuration setting of the system.
<p>•	Destructs data.
•	Disrupts computer network resources.
•	Destructs o f confidential data.
Virus Detection
The most fundamental method of detection of virus is to check the functionality of your computer system; a virus affected computer does not take command properly. However, if there is antivirus software in your computer system, then it can easily check programs and files on a system for virus signatures.
Virus Preventive Measures
A computer system can be protected from virus through the following:
•	Installation of an effective antivirus software.
•	Patching up the operating system.
•	Patching up the client software.
•	Putting highly secured Passwords.
•	Use of Firewalls.
Most Effective Antivirus
Following are the most popular and effective antivirus from which you can choose one for your personal computer:
•	McAfee Antivirus Plus
•	Symantec Norton Antivirus
•	Avast Pro Antivirus
•	Bitdefender Antivirus Plus
•	Kaspersky Anti-Virus
•	Avira Antivirus
•	Webroot Secure Anywhere Antivirus
•	Emsisoft Anti-Malware
•	Quick Heal Antivirus
•	ESET NOD32 Antivirus

INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER/COMMUNICATION NETWORKING
A system of interconnected computers and computerized peripherals such as printers is called computer network. This interconnection among computers facilitates information sharing among them. Computers may connect to each other by either wired or wireless media.
Classification of Computer Networks: Computer networks are classified based on various factors. They include:
•	Geographical span
•	Inter-connectivity
•	Administration
•	Architecture
Geographical Span: 
Geographically, a network can be seen in one of the following categories:
•	It may be spanned across your table, among Bluetooth enabled devices, Ranging not more than few meters.
•	It may be spanned across a whole building, including intermediate devices to connect all floors.
•	It may be spanned across a whole city.
•	It may be spanned across multiple cities or provinces.
•	It may be one network covering whole world.
Inter-Connectivity:
Components of a network can be connected to each other differently in some fashion. By connectedness we mean either logically, physically, or both ways.
•	Every single device can be connected to every other device on network, making the network mesh.
•	All devices can be connected to a single medium but geographically disconnected, created bus like structure.
•	Each device is connected to its left and right peers only, creating linear structure.
•	All devices connected together with a single device, creating star like structure.
•	All devices connected arbitrarily using all previous ways to connect each other, resulting in a hybrid structure.
Administration:</p>
From an administrator’s point of view, a network can be private network which belongs a single autonomous system and cannot be accessed outside its physical or logical domain. A network can be public which is accessed by all
Network Architecture:
Computer networks can be discriminated into various types such as Client-Server, peer-to-peer or hybrid, depending upon its architecture.
•	There can be one or more systems acting as Server. Other being Client, requests the Server to serve requests. Server takes and processes request on behalf of Clients.
•	Two systems can be connected Point-to-Point, or in back-to-back fashion. They both reside at the same level and called peers.
•	There can be hybrid network which involves network architecture of both the above types.
Network Applications
Computer systems and peripherals are connected to form a network. They provide numerous advantages:
•	Resource sharing such as printers and storage devices
•	Exchange of information by means of e-Mails and FTP
•	Information sharing by using Web or Internet
•	Interaction with other users using dynamic web pages
•	IP phones
•	Video conferences
•	Parallel computing
•	Instant messaging
Generally, networks are distinguished based on their geographical span. A network can be as small as distance between your mobile phone and its Bluetooth headphone and as large as the internet itself, covering the whole geographical world.

Geographical Span
(i)	Personal Area Network (PAN)
